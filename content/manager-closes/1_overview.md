# Module 8: Manager Closes

## Objective
Use a structured, low-pressure manager turn to clarify truth, resolve concerns, and align next steps—so the guest feels supported and the deal stays clean.

> “The manager close should feel like help, not pressure.”
—SignatureHyundai Standard

## What this module builds
A manager turn is not a “closer move.”
It’s a **trust tool** that protects:
- the guest experience
- the truth of the deal
- the momentum of the process

---

## What “great” looks like
A guest should leave the manager turn thinking:
- “They listened.”
- “They made this simple.”
- “I feel supported and clear on next steps.”

---

## Why it matters
When a manager turn is done poorly, the guest feels:
- cornered
- judged
- defensive

When it’s done well, the guest feels:
- safe
- respected
- confident

---

## The Manager Close Promise
We do not “overpower.”
We **clarify**.

We use:
- calm tone
- direct truth
- simple options
- one clean ask
