# 2.0 The Science (Why the Manager Turn Works)

## What’s happening in the guest’s mind
A guest who stalls is often experiencing one of these:
- uncertainty (fear of regret)
- lack of clarity (too many moving parts)
- perceived risk (money, time, identity)
- loss of control (feels pushed)

A manager close works when it **reduces threat** and **increases clarity**.

## Principle 1: Authority + Safety (Only when calm)
Authority helps when it feels like protection:
- “Let me make this simple.”
Authority backfires when it feels like pressure:
- “If you don’t do this now…”

---

## Principle 2: Cognitive Load
Stalls often come from mental overload, not resistance.
A manager close should *reduce choices* and *tighten the next step*.

---

## Principle 3: Truth + Trust (“Unshakable Facts”)
A calm, factual summary de-escalates emotion and builds confidence.
Facts aren’t weapons—they’re anchors.

Examples:
- inventory reality
- timeline reality
- process steps
- what was requested vs what’s possible

---

## Principle 4: One Clean Ask
Multiple asks create pressure.
A manager close should end with **one clear question** and **one next step**.
