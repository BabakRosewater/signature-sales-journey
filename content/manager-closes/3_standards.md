# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Clean Handoff (No Surprise Turn)
Sales Consultant sets it up:
- “My manager is here to make sure we’re taking great care of you and keep this simple.”

## Standard 2: Positioning + Tone
- Sit at an angle, not “across the table”
- Calm pace, low ego
- No interruptions, no “taking over”

## Standard 3: Diagnose the Category
Before solving, label it correctly:
- **Question** (needs info)
- **Concern** (needs reassurance/clarity)
- **Objection** (blocking belief)
- **Misalignment** (wrong vehicle, wrong expectations, wrong structure)

## Standard 4: Use “Unshakable Facts” kindly
Facts are shared as clarity:
- “Here’s what’s true so we can make the best decision.”

## Standard 5: Two Options Max
If you present options, keep it to **two**:
- Option A (best fit)
- Option B (simple alternative)

## Standard 6: One Ask + Next Step
End with one clear question:
- “If we can do X, are you comfortable moving forward today?”

## Standard 7: Never Undermine Your Consultant
Avoid:
- “They’re new.”
- “They didn’t explain it right.”
The consultant stays the hero.
