# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Clarity First
Before moving to numbers, the guest should clearly understand:
- why this vehicle fits, and
- what value it creates in their life.

---

## Standard 2: Two-Layer Value
Every key point should include:
- Feature → Outcome
- Outcome → Feeling

Example:
“AWD helps you feel confident on winter roads—less stress, more control.”

---

## Standard 3: Summarize in Their Words
Use a short recap:
- “You said ___ matters because ___.”
- “This option fits because ___.”

---

## Standard 4: 2–3 Options Maximum
Avoid overwhelming.
If needed:
- “Let’s narrow it down to two that best fit what you described.”

---

## Standard 5: Decision Point Question = Permission-Based
No “close-y” pressure lines.
Use calm commitment questions that respect the guest.

---

## Standard 6: Transition to Numbers With Service Tone
Numbers are not a battle.
They are the next step in helping.

Example:
“Would it be helpful if we looked at how it breaks down with the options you chose?”

---

## Standard 7: No Surprise Energy
Keep the tone consistent:
- calm,
- professional,
- confident,
- guest-first.
