**Goal:**
- validate
- simplify (2 options max)
- ask one decision point question

---

## Drill 3: ‘I Need to Think’ (Uncertainty Removal)
Guest says: “I need to think about it.”

**Goal:**
- calm acknowledgement
- isolate uncertainty with one question
- provide clarity
- end with a simple next step

## Drill 4: Two-Choice Close (No Pressure)
Present two best-fit vehicles.

**Goal:**

- tie each to a different value
- ask: “Which feels closer to your life?”

---

## Drill 5: Transition to Numbers (Respect + Confidence)
**Goal:**
Set up numbers like a service step:
“Would it be helpful if…”
No pressure cues.

Debrief:
- What line sounded most human?
- Where did it start feeling like “closing” instead of “helping”?
