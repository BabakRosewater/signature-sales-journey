# 4.0 Scripts & Word Tracks

## 4.1 The Value Recap (Needs → Fit)
“Let me make sure I’m tracking. You told me the big priorities are **{priority 1}**, **{priority 2}**, and **{priority 3}**—mostly because **{why}**.  
That’s why this one stands out: it matches those priorities without forcing tradeoffs.”

## 4.2 Feature → Outcome → Feeling (Value Bridge)
“Because you mentioned **{need}**, this **{feature}** helps give you **{outcome/feeling}**, especially when **{real-life moment}**.”

“On a scale of 1–10, how close is this to what you had in mind?”

2) **If-We-Could**
“If we can make the numbers comfortable, would you feel good moving forward with this one?”

3) **Two-Choice Close (No Pressure)**
“Which feels closer to your life—Option A or Option B?”

## 4.4 Handling ‘I Need to Think’
“Totally fair—this is a big decision.  
Before you think, can I ask one quick thing: what part feels unclear or uncertain right now?”
