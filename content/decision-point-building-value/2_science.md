# 2.0 The Science of Decision & Value (Clarity Wins)

## What’s Happening in the Guest’s Mind
At this stage, guests often feel:
- decision fatigue (too many options)
- fear of regret (what if I choose wrong?)
- loss sensitivity (payments, trade value, time)
- social pressure (spouse, friends, online comparisons)

Your job is to lower cognitive load and increase confidence.

## Principle 1: Choice Overload
More options can reduce action.
Clarity increases commitment.

**Application**
- Present 2–3 best-fit options
- Use simple language and comparisons
- Ask: “Which one feels closest to what you described?”

---

## Principle 2: Framing (Features → Outcomes)
Specs don’t move emotion; outcomes do.

**Application**
- “AWD” → “Confidence in winter”
- “Safety suite” → “Peace of mind with your family”
- “Cargo space” → “Less stress packing and loading”

---

## Principle 3: Loss Aversion
People fear a bad outcome more than they desire a good one.

**Application**
- Reduce perceived risk:
  - “Let’s make this simple.”
  - “We’ll verify the fit before any commitment.”
  - “We’ll keep the next step clear and low-pressure.”

---

## Principle 4: Commitment & Consistency
Small yeses create forward motion.

**Application**
Use micro-commitments:
- “Does this match what you had in mind?”
- “If we can make the numbers comfortable, would this be the one?”

---

## Principle 5: The Peak-End Rule
Guests remember emotional peaks and how the process ends.

**Application**
- Create one “peak” moment (their favorite benefit tied to life)
- End with clarity:
  - what we learned,
  - what they chose,
  - what happens next.

---

## Principle 6: Trust Beats Technique
Value-building only works when the guest believes you’re for them.

**Application**
- Use permission-based language
- Avoid pressure cues
- Maintain a calm, service-first tone
