# 2.0 The Science of Decision + Value (Clarity Wins)

## What’s Happening in the Guest’s Mind
At this stage, guests are balancing:
- excitement (this could be the one)
- uncertainty (what if I regret it?)
- mental load (options, trims, payments, trade)
- social influence (partner, friends, online reviews)

Your job is to reduce cognitive load and increase confidence.

## Principle 1: Choice Overload
Too many choices increases delay.
Clarity creates movement.

**Application**
- Narrow to 2–3 best-fit options
- Use plain-language comparisons
- Ask: “Which feels closer to your life?”

---

## Principle 2: Framing (Outcomes Beat Specs)
A feature is just information.
An outcome is meaning.

**Application**
- AWD → confidence in winter
- driver assist → peace of mind with family
- cargo space → less stress and easier routines
- warranty coverage → feeling protected

---

## Principle 3: Loss Aversion (Fear of a Bad Decision)
Guests fear getting stuck or making a mistake.

**Application**
- reduce perceived risk with calm language:
  - “Let’s make this simple.”
  - “We’ll keep the next step clear.”
  - “No pressure—just clarity.”

---

## Principle 4: Commitment + Consistency
Small “yes” moments build momentum.

**Application**
- Fit check: “How close is this to what you had in mind?”
- Conditional: “If we can make numbers comfortable…”
- Two-choice: “Which feels closer—A or B?”

---

## Principle 5: Peak-End
Guests remember emotional peaks and how the phase ends.

**Application**
- create one “aha” (their favorite outcome)
- end with a crisp summary + next step
