# Module 5: Decision Point & Building Value

## Objective
Guide guests to a confident decision by clarifying what matters most, translating features into real-life outcomes, and leading a calm, trust-first Decision Point conversation before numbers.

> “Clarity is kindness.”
— SignatureHyundai Standard

## What the Decision Point Is (Hood Ornament Moment)
This is the moment the guest quietly decides:
- “This fits my life,” and
- “I can see myself owning this.”

They may not say it yet, but you can feel it:
- they’re picturing real life,
- questions shift from “what is it?” to “how would it work for me?”
- they compare, hesitate, or ask about price/payment timing.

**Our job:** make the decision feel **clear, safe, and simple**.

## Why This Module Matters
Most deals aren’t lost on the vehicle.
They’re lost when the guest feels:
- overwhelmed by options
- uncertain about fit
- afraid of regret
- unclear about next steps

We win here by lowering confusion and building confidence—without pressure.

## The Decision Point Flow (Simple)
### 1) Recap Priorities (in their words)
“You said ___, ___, ___ — because ___.”

### 2) Confirm Fit
“That’s why this one stands out…”

### 3) Build Value (Outcomes, not specs)
Confidence. Comfort. Safety. Simplicity. Ease.

### 4) Ask a Respectful Micro-Commitment
“If we can make the numbers comfortable, would you feel good moving forward?”

### 5) Transition to Numbers (Service Tone)
“Want to see what it looks like with the options you chose?”

## What “Great” Looks Like
- Guest feels guided, not pushed.
- The “why” is clear and repeatable.
- The next step is obvious and calm.
- You protect trust while moving forward.
