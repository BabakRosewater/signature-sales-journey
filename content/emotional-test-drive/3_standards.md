# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Pre-Drive Setup (Always)
Before shifting into gear, you must:
- confirm their top 2 priorities
- explain the route/time
- invite comfort preferences (temp, seat, music off/on)
- create one “focus moment” you’ll highlight

---

## Standard 2: 70/30 Rule
Guest experience > consultant performance.
They should speak more than you.

---

## Standard 3: Only Highlight What Matters
No feature dumping.
Every feature must connect to:
- a stated need
- a feeling
- a real-life moment

---

## Standard 4: Micro-Confirmations Every 60–90 Seconds
Keep alignment high and prevent confusion.

---

## Standard 5: Permission-Based Prompts
- “Would it be helpful if…”
- “Can I point something out here…”
- “Do you want to feel what this does on the highway…”

---

## Standard 6: Calm Confidence (No Pressure)
Avoid urgency unless true.
Clarity is the strongest close.

---

## Standard 7: Post-Drive Fit Questions (Always)
Ask:
- “How close is this to what you had in mind?”
- “What did you like most?”
- “What would you change?”
- “What do you want to compare it to?”
