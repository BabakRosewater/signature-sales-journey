# Module 4: Emotional Test Drive

## Objective
Guide the guest through a test drive that connects features to feelings, reduces uncertainty, and builds confident ownership vision—without pressure.

> “A sale is not something you pursue; it’s what happens to you while you are immersed in serving others.”

## Why This Module Matters
Most test drives fail for one simple reason:
**They become a demonstration instead of an experience.**

A great Emotional Test Drive does three things:
1) **Creates safety** (guest feels comfortable + in control)
2) **Creates meaning** (features become benefits tied to their life)
3) **Creates confidence** (guest can picture ownership)

## The Emotional Test Drive Flow (Simple + Repeatable)
### Step 1 — SETUP (Before we move)
- Set expectations
- Confirm priorities
- Choose 1–2 “focus moments” to highlight

### Step 2 — EXPERIENCE (During the drive)
- Prompt real-life visualization
- Highlight features *only* when they connect to their priorities
- Use micro-confirmations

### Step 3 — CONFIRM (After the drive)
- Ask “fit” questions
- Compare to what they told you in discovery
- Clarify next step (without pressure)

## What “Success” Looks Like
By the end of the test drive, the guest should be able to say:
- “That felt easy.”
- “I can see this fitting my life.”
- “This solves what matters to me.”
