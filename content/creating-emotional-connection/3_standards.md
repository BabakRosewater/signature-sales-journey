# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Earn the Right to Go Deeper
Before deeper questions or “future pacing,” ask permission:
- “Can I ask a quick question to make sure I’m on the right track?”
- “Would it be helpful if I showed you how this fits your day-to-day?”

---

## Standard 2: 70/30 Rule (They Talk More Than We Do)
Your goal is a guest who feels heard.
- You listen
- you reflect
- you ask the next best question

---

## Standard 3: Use the “Name It” Skill (Calmly)
You can name emotions without being intense:
- “That makes sense.”
- “That’s a fair concern.”
- “I can see why that matters.”

---

## Standard 4: Build a Values Bridge
Every important feature must connect to:
- comfort
- safety
- pride
- confidence
- simplicity
- reliability
- freedom

---

## Standard 5: Future Pace with Real Scenarios
Avoid vague hype.
Use specific life moments:
- “On winter mornings…”
- “When you’re merging onto the highway…”
- “When you’re loading groceries…”
- “When you’re driving the kids…”

---

## Standard 6: Micro-Confirmations (Every 60–90 Seconds)
Examples:
- “How does that feel?”
- “Is that matching what you pictured?”
- “Does that solve what you were concerned about?”

---

## Standard 7: No Manipulation Language
Avoid:
- guilt
- fear tactics
- “If you cared about your family…”
- pressure timelines (unless true and stated calmly)

We build urgency through clarity, not intensity.
