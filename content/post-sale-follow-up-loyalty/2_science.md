# 2.0 The Science of Loyalty (Trust + Memory + Consistency)

## Principle 1: The First 7–10 Days Decide Emotional Memory
Customers form their strongest ownership impression early.
If they feel unsupported, they will rationalize the purchase negatively.

**Application**
- Follow up quickly
- Solve friction fast
- Reinforce why the vehicle fits their life

---

## Principle 2: “Helpfulness” Builds Loyalty Faster Than Discounts
People remember support and reliability more than “a good deal.”

**Application**
- Offer small wins: setup, how-to, quick answers
- Make service feel welcoming
- Reduce uncertainty and confusion

---

## Principle 3: Consistency Signals Professionalism
A consistent cadence makes customers feel remembered—not hunted.

**Application**
Use a predictable follow-up rhythm with human language:
- 24–48 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 90 days
- service milestones

---

## Principle 4: Reciprocity (Earn the Ask)
When you help first, customers want to give back.

**Application**
Only ask for:
- reviews
- referrals
after you’ve delivered support and solved something real.

---

## Principle 5: “Service Familiarity” Drives Retention
Service retention increases when customers:
- know who to contact
- understand what to expect
- feel comfortable walking in

**Application**
Introduce service early as part of ownership success:
- first maintenance plan
- first appointment setup
- “what to expect” explanation
