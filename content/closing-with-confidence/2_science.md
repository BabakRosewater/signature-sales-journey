# 2.0 The Science of Closing (Decision Confidence + Simplicity)

## What’s Happening in the Guest’s Brain
At closing, the guest’s risk signals rise:
- fear of regret
- fear of being taken advantage of
- uncertainty about “the right move”

Your job is to reduce cognitive load and increase decision confidence.

---

## Principle 1: Cognitive Load (Overwhelm Kills Decisions)
When information feels heavy, people delay.

**Application**
- keep numbers simple
- summarize first
- pause and let them process

---

## Principle 2: Loss Aversion (Fear of Losing > Desire to Gain)
Guests feel the risk of “making a mistake” more than the joy of “getting a great car.”

**Application**
- emphasize protection + confidence
- clarify what they’re getting and why it fits
- avoid pressure that increases fear

---

## Principle 3: Choice Architecture (Two Options Beats Ten)
Too many choices creates anxiety and “I need to think.”

**Application**
- offer 2 clear paths:
  - “Option A: lower payment / longer term”
  - “Option B: shorter term / faster equity”
- ask preference: “Which fits your life better?”

---

## Principle 4: Commitment & Consistency
When guests affirm what matters to them, they’re more likely to act consistently.

**Application**
- recap their priorities
- tie numbers back to those priorities
- confirm alignment before commitment ask

---

## Principle 5: Procedural Fairness
People accept outcomes more when the process feels fair, transparent, and respectful.

**Application**
- narrate your intention: “I’ll keep this simple.”
- show your work without over-explaining
- invite questions without defensiveness

---

## Principle 6: Peak-End
They remember the emotional ending.
If the close ends with clarity and respect, the relationship continues even if they don’t buy today.

**Application**
- end with a calm next step
- confirm the guest feels in control
