# 2.0 The Science

Discovery and appraisal are not just “questions and paperwork.” They’re trust-building moments powered by psychology.

## Key Psychological Principles

### Active Listening
**Principle:** Fully concentrate, understand, respond thoughtfully.  
**Application:**
- Paraphrase and summarize
- Ask open-ended questions
- Affirm the customer’s priorities  
**Example:**
- “Fuel efficiency matters to you—tell me what your commute looks like day to day.”

### Empathy
**Principle:** Understand and validate emotion.  
**Application:**
- Acknowledge concerns without minimizing
- Show genuine interest  
**Example:**
- “I can see why safety is a priority—let’s make sure we match you with the right protection and features.”

### Trust Building
**Principle:** Consistency + transparency + follow-through.  
**Application:**
- Be clear about steps and time
- Don’t guess—verify and report back  
**Example:**
- “If I don’t have that answer immediately, I’ll find out and follow up quickly.”

### Priming
**Principle:** Positive tone influences perception and comfort.  
**Application:**
- Use calm, confident language early
- Frame the process as helpful and simple  
**Example:**
- “We’ll make this easy—just a few questions so we can narrow this down fast.”

### Framing
**Principle:** How we present info changes decisions.  
**Application:**
- Present features as *benefits tied to their needs*  
**Example:**
- “Because you’re in snow and highway driving, AWD + driver-assist is about confidence and fatigue reduction.”

### Social Proof
**Principle:** People look to others to validate choices.  
**Application:**
- Share real patterns (“Most people like you…”)  
**Example:**
- “A lot of families with your needs end up choosing this setup because it balances space and efficiency.”

### Loss Aversion
**Principle:** People avoid losses more than they pursue gains.  
**Application:**
- Use ethically—avoid fear tactics
- Highlight timing constraints only when real  
**Example:**
- “If color/trim is important, availability can change quickly—so we’ll want to confirm options early.”

## Daily Application Strategies
- **Active Listening + Empathy:** Open-ended questions + reflective summaries  
- **Trust Building:** Transparent steps + keep promises  
- **Priming + Framing:** Positive tone + benefit-based communication  
- **Social Proof:** Use credibility markers (reviews, patterns, outcomes)  
- **Loss Aversion:** Protect the customer from wasted time, missed options, or wrong-fit decisions

## Continuous Improvement Loop
- Seek feedback (customer + peers)
- Share wins and misses in huddles
- Stay updated on lineup and incentives
- Reflect after each interaction: what worked / what to improve
