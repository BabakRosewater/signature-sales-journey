# Module 02: Uncovering Needs & Building Trust

**Objective:** Gain a deep understanding of customer needs, preferences, timeline, and budget. Integrate appraisal early to build trust, offer solutions, and save time. Build an efficient, transparent, and trust-based environment.

## What “Great” Looks Like
By the end of this step, we should have:

- A clear picture of **how** the customer will use the vehicle (daily life + edge cases)
- A clear list of **must-haves**, **nice-to-haves**, and **deal-breakers**
- A realistic **budget/payment comfort zone** (without pressure)
- Trade situation clarified: **trade / no trade / unsure**
- If trade exists, appraisal is started **early** with clear purpose + transparency
- A strong **bridge into Selection** (2–3 best-fit options)

## Why This Step Matters
Discovery + early appraisal is where we earn trust.

- It reduces friction later (price, payments, trade value).
- It prevents wasted time showing “cool cars” that don’t fit.
- It positions us as a **trusted advisor** instead of a transaction.

## Non-Negotiable Behaviors
- Ask **open-ended questions** first.
- Listen more than you talk.
- Confirm understanding by summarizing.
- Make the appraisal feel like a **customer benefit**, not a dealership step.
- Take notes (CRM + personal recall) so the customer feels remembered.

## Core Transition Line
Use this when moving to Selection:

> “Based on what you shared—(need 1), (need 2), and staying around (budget/comfort)—I have 2–3 options that fit really well. Let’s look at them together.”
