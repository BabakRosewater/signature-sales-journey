# Module 10: After They Say Yes

## Objective
Lock in trust and momentum after commitment by guiding the guest through next steps with clarity, celebration, and zero surprises—so they feel confident, cared for, and excited to take delivery.

> “People don’t remember the paperwork. They remember how you made the process feel.”

## Why This Module Matters
The moment the guest says **“Yes”** is not the finish line—it’s a **high-risk transition point**.

This is where deals can fall apart due to:
- confusion (“What happens now?”)
- delays and uncertainty
- sudden pressure or tone changes
- sloppy handoffs
- surprises (fees, timing, trade details, approval steps)

We protect the yes by making the next steps **simple, calm, and predictable**.

## What Great Looks Like
A guest who has said yes should feel:
- **celebrated** (without being awkward)
- **in control** (clear roadmap)
- **safe** (no surprises)
- **taken care of** (smooth handoff + communication)
- **excited** (positive future pacing to delivery)
