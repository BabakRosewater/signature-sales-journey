# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Confirm the Yes Cleanly
No ambiguity.
- “Perfect — we’ll go with the {vehicle} in {trim/color}. Sound good?”

---

## Standard 2: Celebrate Briefly (Human, Not Hype)
A small positive moment:
- “Nice choice.”
- “You’re going to love this.”
- “This fits what you told me.”

---

## Standard 3: The 3-Step Roadmap
Always use a clear structure:
1) quick details confirmation
2) next step / finance / paperwork
3) delivery timing + what to expect

---

## Standard 4: Time Expectations Up Front
Set an honest timeframe.
- “This typically takes about __ minutes. I’ll keep it moving and keep you updated.”

---

## Standard 5: No Surprises Language
If something might change, say it calmly:
- “The only variable is approval timing, but I’ll walk you through it.”

---

## Standard 6: Warm Handoff (No Dumping)
Introduce the next person with context + confidence:
- name, role, what they’ll help with, and why it benefits the guest

---

## Standard 7: Capture Notes Immediately
Your CRM notes must include:
- vehicle chosen + alternates
- trade details and expectations
- payment/term guardrails (if discussed)
- delivery preferences + timing
- any sensitivities (time, anxiety, past bad experience)

---

## Standard 8: Keep Them Informed Every 10–15 Minutes
If they’re waiting, they need updates.
Silence creates doubt.
