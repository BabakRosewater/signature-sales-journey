# 2.0 The Science of “After Yes” (Momentum + Regret Prevention)

## What’s Happening Psychologically
After commitment, guests often experience a rapid switch from:
**excitement → anxiety**.

Common thought loops:
- “Did I move too fast?”
- “What if I could have gotten a better deal?”
- “What if something goes wrong?”
- “Am I going to get pressured in finance?”

Your job after “yes” is to reduce uncertainty and keep trust stable.

## Principle 1: Buyer’s Remorse Risk Peaks After Commitment
Once the decision is made, the brain looks for confirmation it was a good choice.
If the process becomes confusing, slow, or tense, doubt grows.

**Application**
- Confirm decision with calm certainty
- Reinforce why it fits their priorities (1 sentence)
- Move into a clear roadmap immediately

---

## Principle 2: Uncertainty Feels Like Risk
Even small unknowns feel large:
- “How long will this take?”
- “Who am I working with now?”
- “What’s the process?”
- “What happens with the trade?”

**Application**
- Provide a short, predictable sequence (3 steps)
- Set time expectations
- Explain handoffs before they happen

---

## Principle 3: Tone Shift Breaks Trust
Guests notice when the energy changes from warm → transactional.
That shift feels like: “Now they’ve got me.”

**Application**
- Keep the same calm, caring tone post-yes
- Use permission-based language in finance transition
- Frame steps as support, not control

---

## Principle 4: “Peak-End” Matters Most Here
The end of the sales process becomes the memory that drives:
- CSI
- referrals
- loyalty
- reviews

**Application**
- Create a positive “peak” (simple celebration)
- Create a confident “end” (delivery setup + reassurance)

## Principle 5: Cognitive Load Kills Momentum
Too many details = mental fatigue and impatience.

**Application**
- “Three-step roadmap”
- One sentence per step
- Confirm understanding
