# 3.0 Success Standards (Non-Negotiables)

## Standard 1: Short Tour (3–6 Minutes)
Long tours feel like a stall. Keep it purposeful.

---

## Standard 2: Purpose First
Always state why you’re touring:
“I want you to see how we support you after the sale.”

---

## Standard 3: One Service Proof Moment
Service drive / advisor introduction / scheduling process.
This is the credibility anchor.

---

## Standard 4: Introductions = Value
Only introduce people who add confidence.
1–3 intros max.

---

## Standard 5: No Corny Scripts
Keep it human, calm, and respectful.
No “we’re one big family” language.

---

## Standard 6: Clean Transition Back
End the tour with the next step:
“Now we’ll look at numbers clearly.”

---

## Standard 7: Guest Comfort Matters
Offer water/coffee/restroom without awkwardness:
“Before we sit down, do you need water or a restroom break?”
