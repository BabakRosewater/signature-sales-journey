# Module 6: Dealership Tour & Introduction

## Objective
Use a short, purposeful dealership tour to increase comfort, credibility, and trust—introducing key people and touchpoints that reinforce how we support the guest before, during, and after the sale.

> “Trust isn’t built by what we say. It’s built by what we prove.”
— SignatureHyundai Standard

## Why We Do the Tour
A great tour is not about showing off the building.
It’s about showing the guest:
- **where support comes from**
- **who’s on their team**
- **what ownership will feel like here**

It reduces fear, increases comfort, and creates credibility—especially before numbers.

---

## When to Do It (Timing)
Best timing is after the guest has a strong fit feeling:
- emotional test drive is landing
- decision point is forming
- guest is leaning positive

If you do it too early, it feels like a script.
If you do it too late, it feels like a stall.

---

## What a Great Tour Accomplishes
- Removes uncertainty (“I know where I am and who helps me.”)
- Humanizes the dealership (“These are real people.”)
- Anchors service confidence (“They can take care of me.”)
- Sets up the next step cleanly (“Now we’ll look at numbers.”)

## The Tour Framework (3–6 minutes)
### 1) Welcome + Purpose
“This will take 3 minutes—I just want you to see how we support you.”

### 2) Service Credibility Moment
Show service drive / advisor check-in / scheduling support.

### 3) Key Introductions (1–3 max)
Manager (optional), Service Advisor (ideal), Business Office / Delivery specialist (optional)

### 4) Comfort & Amenities (quick)
Waiting area, coffee, Wi-Fi, restrooms—reduce stress.

### 5) Transition Back to Next Step
“Now that you’ve seen support, let’s look at the numbers clearly.”

## Success Outcome
Guest should feel:
- “These people have my back.”
- “This feels professional.”
- “Ownership here will be easy.”
