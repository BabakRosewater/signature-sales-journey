# 2.0 The Science of the Dealership Tour (Comfort + Credibility)

## What Guests Feel in a Dealership
Even confident buyers can feel:
- uncertainty (“Am I going to be pressured?”)
- lack of control (“Who do I deal with after I buy?”)
- fear of regret (“Will service be a nightmare?”)

A short tour reduces threat and increases trust.

## Principle 1: Familiarity Reduces Anxiety
People relax when a place feels known.
The tour turns “unknown environment” into “known environment.”

**Application**
- Keep it short and calm
- point out only what helps the guest

---

## Principle 2: Social Proof + Credibility
Seeing a real service operation and real people creates confidence.
It’s “proof,” not a promise.

**Application**
- a quick service touchpoint is stronger than a long showroom walk

---

## Principle 3: The Support Story
Guests don’t just buy a car—they buy support.
A tour reframes the dealership as a long-term partner.

**Application**
- connect service/process to the guest’s life
- “This is where you’ll be taken care of.”

---

## Principle 4: Peak-End
If the tour includes one reassuring moment and ends with clarity,
it becomes a positive emotional anchor before numbers.

**Application**
- one “support proof” moment
- one clear transition sentence
