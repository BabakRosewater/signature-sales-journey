# 1.0 The Science of First Impressions

At Clark Hyundai, Greeting / First Impressions isn’t just “saying hello.” It’s a repeatable set of behaviors grounded in psychology — designed to create trust quickly and consistently.

## Key Psychological Principles

### 1) Thin-Slicing
**What it means:** People make fast judgments from very limited information (often seconds).  
**How we use it:** Your posture, tone, attire, and the environment *immediately* shape trust.

**Micro-behaviors**
- open stance, shoulders back  
- genuine smile + eye contact  
- calm pace (not rushed)

*Reference: Ambady & Rosenthal (1992).*

### 2) Halo Effect
**What it means:** A strong first interaction shapes the guest’s perception of the whole dealership.  
**How we use it:** The greeting is the “tone setter” for Sales, Service, and the brand.

**Micro-behaviors**
- warm welcome + professional cadence  
- treat every guest like a referral

*Reference: Nisbett & Wilson (1977).*

---

### 3) Primacy Effect
**What it means:** First information anchors what people remember and expect next.  
**How we use it:** The greeting should be warm **and** oriented toward help.

**Micro-behaviors**
- “What brought you in today?” (open-ended)  
- confirm comfort + offer guidance

*Reference: Asch (1946).*

---

### 4) Emotional Contagion
**What it means:** Your energy transfers to the guest.  
**How we use it:** We lead with calm confidence — not intensity.

**Micro-behaviors**
- match energy level  
- avoid “over-selling” excitement  
- be steady and reassuring

*Reference: Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson (1994).*

---

### 5) Expectation Confirmation
**What it means:** Satisfaction comes from meeting/exceeding expectations formed early.  
**How we use it:** Don’t promise what we can’t deliver. Set clear next steps.

**Micro-behaviors**
- “Here’s what we’ll do next…”  
- keep commitments small and real

*Reference: Oliver (1980).*

---

### 6) Environment & Context (Servicescapes)
**What it means:** The physical space changes trust and perception.  
**How we use it:** Clean, organized, welcoming spaces reduce friction and doubt.

**Micro-behaviors**
- tidy desks, clear pathways  
- vehicles presented like we respect them

*Reference: Bitner (1992).*

---

### 7) Mirroring & Matching
**What it means:** Subtle alignment builds rapport.  
**How we use it:** Match tone, pace, and formality without imitating.

**Micro-behaviors**
- mirror speaking pace  
- match formality (“sir/ma’am” vs first name)

*Reference: Chartrand & Bargh (1999).*
