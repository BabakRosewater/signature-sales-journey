# 1.2 Facility Appearance Standards

## Why the environment matters
A clean, organized dealership signals professionalism and trust. A cluttered environment creates doubt and distraction.

## Key Areas We Protect

### Entrance & Showroom
- clean glass, floors, and clear pathways  
- welcoming signage and uncluttered entry

### Workstations
- no personal clutter (food, old papers)  
- only clean, branded materials visible to guests

### Vehicle Presentation
- interiors wiped, glass clean, no fingerprints  
- clear info available (features, tags, quick notes)

## Daily Standards
- quick walkthroughs (open + mid-day + close)  
- rotate responsibility  
- showroom vehicles checked daily

# 1.3 Greeting Scenarios

## Walk-In
“Hi — thanks for coming in. What brings you in today — shopping or just starting the research?”

## Drive-Up
“Welcome in. Is there something specific you came to see, or would you like a few options?”

## Browser
“Has anyone had a chance to greet you yet?”  
If no: “Welcome — please take your time. If you want pricing or details, I’m right here whenever you’re ready.”

## Close Proximity (Service Guest)
“Are we getting you taken care of today?”  
Then: “While you’re here, if you’re curious, I can show you what’s new — no pressure.”

## Weather-Adapted
“It’s [cold/hot/wet] out there — let’s get you comfortable inside. Can I get you water or coffee while we look at options?”
