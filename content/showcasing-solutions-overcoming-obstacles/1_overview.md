## Outcomes we’re aiming for

By the end of this module, we can:

- Present **2–3 best-fit options** with a clear “why”
- Use **primary + alternate selection** to prevent stalls
- Separate **questions vs concerns vs objections**
- Respond with **empathy + facts + confident language**
- Apply **Feel · Felt · Found** without sounding scripted
- Know when and how to execute a **Turn** that protects the guest experience

---

## What you’ll practice

- Transitioning from Discovery into Selection
- Aligning features to needs (benefit-first language)
- Handling common objections without tension
- Running a smooth Turn: giving + receiving
