# 4.0 Scripts and Word Tracks

## 4.1 Transition from Discovery → Selection
**Script A (simple, confident):**
“Thanks for walking me through what matters most. Based on what you told me, I’m going to narrow this to **two or three best-fit options** so it feels simple. I’ll explain why each one fits, and you tell me what you want to see first.”

**Script B (confirm priorities):**
“Let me make sure I got this right: your top priorities are **{priority_1}**, **{priority_2}**, and **{priority_3}**. Did I capture that right? Perfect—now I’ll show you a couple of vehicles that match that.”

---

## 4.2 Primary Selection Walkaround (Needs → Feature → Benefit)
“Because you mentioned **{need}**, this vehicle’s **{feature}** helps by **{benefit}**.  
How does that feel for your day-to-day?”

Examples:
- “Because you mentioned winter driving, AWD helps you feel confident in bad weather.”
- “Because you mentioned family trips, the third-row access makes loading easier.”

---

## 4.3 Introducing the Alternate Selection (Positive, Not a Fallback)
“Based on what you told me, I have another option I think you’ll really like—especially since you mentioned **{need}**.  
This one still covers the must-haves and adds **{extra_benefit}**.”

---

## 4.4 Handling Questions (clarity + link to need)
“Great question. The answer is **{answer}**. Since you mentioned **{need}**, that helps because **{benefit}**.  
Does that answer it, or do you want me to show you on the vehicle?”

---

## 4.5 Handling Concerns (validate → reassure → option)
“I understand—that’s a fair concern. Staying within **{priority}** matters.  
Here’s what I can do: we can look at **{option_1}** and **{option_2}** so it feels comfortable.  
Would that help?”

---

## 4.6 Handling Objections (AERI)
**Guest:** “This feels too expensive.”
- **Acknowledge:** “That’s fair.”
- **Empathize:** “I understand why that matters—budget is real.”
- **Reframe:** “Let’s look at what you’re getting for that price—especially around {need}.”
- **Invite:** “Would it help if we compare two trims side-by-side and see what changes the payment most?”

---

## 4.7 Feel / Felt / Found (classic)
“I understand how you feel. Many guests have felt the same way at first.  
What they found was that once we looked at the long-term value—{reframe_value}—it became a lot clearer.  
Would you like to look at that together?”

---

## 4.8 Objection Isolation (find the real barrier)
“Can I ask a quick question—  
is it more about **{option_a}** or **{option_b}**?”

“If we solved **{barrier}**, would you feel comfortable moving forward?”

“Besides that, is there anything else holding you back?”

---

## 4.9 Giving the Turn (setup + value)
“To make sure you get the best answer and everything feels clear, I’m going to bring in **{expert_role}**.  
They’re great at **{expertise_area}**. I’ll stay right here with you.”

(Then introduce with context)
“{team_member_name}, this is {guest_name}. They’re focused on {top_need} and had a question about {topic}.”

---

## 4.10 Receiving the Turn (rapport + continuity)
“Hi {guest_name}, I’m {name}. {salesperson_name} filled me in on what matters most to you, and I’m here to help with {topic}.  
Let’s keep this simple—what would you like clarity on first?”

---

## 4.11 Guest Wants to Leave (respect + next step)
“I completely respect that. No pressure at all.  
If you’d like, I can text/email the top two options we discussed so you can review at your pace.  
What’s the easiest way to send that to you?”
