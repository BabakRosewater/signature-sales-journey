# 3.0 Success Standards (What “Great” Looks Like)

## Standard 1: The 2–3 Best Fit Options Rule
**We do not overwhelm guests.**  
- Present **2–3 best-fit** options based on Discovery
- Explain why you chose them
- Invite the guest to choose what to see first

**Green light:** guest feels clear and calm  
**Red flag:** guest feels flooded and confused

---

## Standard 2: Needs → Feature → Benefit (No Feature Dumping)
Every highlight must connect to what the guest said matters.
- Need: “You mentioned winter driving and safety…”
- Feature: “This model has AWD + lane keep + blind spot…”
- Benefit: “That means more confidence and less stress in bad weather.”

---

## Standard 3: Confirm Alignment Often
You should “check-in” repeatedly:
- “How does that feel for your day-to-day?”
- “Does that solve what you were concerned about?”
- “Is this matching what you pictured?”

---

## Standard 4: Alternate Selection is Positive (Not a Fallback)
Alternate selection is presented as:
- “another strong fit”
- “a better match for one key priority”
- “an option that protects your budget / space / comfort / capability”

Never present alternate as:
- “Plan B”
- “Since you can’t afford this…”
- “Well, maybe this will work…”

---

## Standard 5: Identify the Feedback Type (Before Responding)
### Questions
Information-seeking. Answer clearly; link to their need.

### Concerns
Worry/anxiety. Validate first; then reassure; then offer options.

### Objections
A barrier to moving forward. Isolate the real issue and respond with value + a next step.

---

## Standard 6: Objection Handling Frameworks
### AERI
- **Acknowledge:** “That’s fair.”
- **Empathize:** “I understand why that matters.”
- **Reframe:** “Here’s the way to look at it…”
- **Invite:** “Would it help if we…?”

### Feel / Felt / Found
- “I understand how you feel…”
- “Many people have felt that way…”
- “What they found was…”

### Objection Isolation (Must-Have Skill)
Before solving, isolate:
- “Is it more about A or B?”
- “If we solved X, would you feel comfortable moving forward?”
- “Besides that, is anything else holding you back?”

---

## Standard 7: Turn 100% (No Awkward Hand-offs)
A great turn includes:
1) **Explain why** (benefit to guest)
2) **Build up** the team member
3) **Stay present** (or explain you’ll return)
4) **Give context** so the guest doesn’t repeat themselves
5) **Move forward** with a next step

---

## Standard 8: Language Standards
Use:
- calm, confident, respectful tone
- “Let’s” and “together” language
- permission-based phrases (“Would it be helpful if…”)

Avoid:
- defensive tone
- “Trust me”
- “That’s just our policy” (without value-based explanation)
- pressure phrases (“You have to decide now”)
