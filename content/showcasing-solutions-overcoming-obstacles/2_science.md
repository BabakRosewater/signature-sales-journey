# The Science Behind Selection, Objections, and Turns

**Purpose:** Use proven psychological principles to guide decision-making with trust, clarity, and calm momentum.

## Why this matters

Selection and objections aren’t “logic problems.” They’re **human** problems—made of emotions, uncertainty, identity, and perceived risk.

Our job is to:
- reduce confusion,
- increase confidence,
- and keep the guest feeling supported.

## Part I: Science of Selection + Alternate Selection

### Reciprocity (Cialdini)
**What it is:** People naturally return kindness.  
**How we use it:** Small gestures create goodwill and openness.

**Example:** “Can I grab you a coffee or water while we look at the options?”

---

### Commitment & Consistency (Cialdini)
**What it is:** People act in line with what they’ve already said matters.  
**How we use it:** Re-anchor to what the guest already told us.

**Example:** “You said safety is non-negotiable—this trim includes the full safety package.”

---

### Social Proof (Cialdini)
**What it is:** People look to others when uncertain.  
**How we use it:** Normalize the decision with relevant examples.

**Example:** “This is our most popular choice for families who want comfort + safety.”

---

### Authority (Cialdini)
**What it is:** Expertise lowers fear.  
**How we use it:** Demonstrate knowledge without flexing.

**Example:** “This model earned top safety ratings and includes the newest driver-assist tech.”

---

### Liking (Cialdini)
**What it is:** People trust people they like.  
**How we use it:** Genuine connection + shared perspective.

**Example:** “If weekend trips are your thing, you’ll love how this cargo area works in real life.”

---

### Scarcity (Cialdini)
**What it is:** Limited availability increases urgency.  
**How we use it:** Truthful, calm, and non-pushy.

**Example:** “This is the last one in this color with the premium package.”

---

### Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman)
**What it is:** People decide with emotion (System 1) and justify with logic (System 2).  
**How we use it:** Pair emotion + proof.

- **System 1:** stories, imagery, “picture yourself…”
- **System 2:** specs, warranty, comparisons, total value

---

### Motivation Beyond Basic Needs (Pink)
**What it is:** People want autonomy, mastery, purpose.  
**How we use it:** Give choices and connect to goals.

**Example:** “You’ll have choices here—let’s find what fits your lifestyle and priorities.”

---

### Predictably Irrational (Ariely)
**What it is:** Bias shapes decisions (anchoring, fear of loss, price framing).  
**How we use it:** Help the guest compare fairly and see long-term value.

**Example:** “Let’s look at total ownership—fuel, warranty, and safety value—not just the sticker.”

---

## Part II: Science of the Turn (Turn 100%)

A **Turn** happens when we introduce another team member into the conversation to add value.

### Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger)
**What it is:** People feel discomfort when reality doesn’t match expectations.  
**How we use it:** Explain the benefit of the Turn before it happens.

**Example:** “To make sure you get the best answer, I’m bringing in our specialist—this will save you time.”

---

### Social Proof (Cialdini)
**What it is:** “Others do this too.”  
**How we use it:** Normalize team support.

**Example:** “Many guests appreciate a second set of eyes when comparing options.”

---

### Reciprocity (Cialdini)
**What it is:** Feeling supported increases cooperation.  
**How we use it:** Frame the Turn as service.

**Example:** “We’re a team—our job is to make sure you’re fully supported.”
