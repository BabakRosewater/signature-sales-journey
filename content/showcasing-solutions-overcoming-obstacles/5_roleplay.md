# 5.0 Role-Play Lab (Manager-Led)

## Purpose
Build comfort and consistency under real-world pressure:
- selection clarity
- alternate selection pivots
- question/concern/objection recognition
- objection isolation
- turn 100% (give + receive)

---

## Setup (Teams of 3)
- Role 1: Sales Consultant
- Role 2: Guest
- Role 3: Coach/Observer (score + feedback)

Rotate every 6–8 minutes.

---

## Drill 1: Transition to Selection (6 minutes)
**Goal:** Use Discovery recap + 2–3 option framing.
- Must include: “two or three best-fit options”
- Must include: priority confirmation question

**Observer scores:**
- Clarity (1–5)
- Calm/confident tone (1–5)
- Guest autonomy preserved (1–5)

---

## Drill 2: Primary Selection Walkaround (8 minutes)
**Goal:** Use Needs → Feature → Benefit + invite feedback.
- Must include: at least 3 “How does that feel?” check-ins

**Guest cues to give:**
- Excitement about one feature
- Confusion about another
- A small concern (budget or size)

---

## Drill 3: Alternate Selection Pivot (6 minutes)
**Goal:** Read signals and pivot positively (no “fallback” language).
**Guest signal examples:**
- “I like it, but I’m not sure about cargo space…”
- “It’s a little higher than I expected…”
- “I don’t know… I need to think.”

**Must include:**
- “Especially since you mentioned {need}…”
- “Still covers the must-haves and adds {extra_benefit}…”

---

## Drill 4: Question vs Concern vs Objection (8 minutes)
Coach reads statements. Consultant must:
1) label it (Question / Concern / Objection)
2) respond using the correct approach

Examples:
- “Does this have AWD?” (Question)
- “I’m worried about monthly payments.” (Concern)
- “This is too expensive.” (Objection)

---

## Drill 5: Objection Isolation (8 minutes)
**Goal:** isolate the real barrier before solving.
Must use at least 2 of:
- “Is it more about A or B?”
- “If we solved X, would we be good?”
- “Besides that, anything else holding you back?”

---

## Drill 6: Turn 100% (10 minutes)
**Scenario A (Giving the turn):**
Guest is stuck on payment and credibility.
Consultant turns to manager/finance specialist.

**Scenario B (Receiving the turn):**
You step in cold but must maintain continuity and comfort.

**Observer scores:**
- Turn framed as service/value (1–5)
- Guest doesn’t repeat themselves (1–5)
- Next step established (1–5)

---

## Debrief Questions (2 minutes)
- What increased trust the most?
- Where did language feel scripted?
- What made the guest feel most in control?
