## 2.1 Why Script Discipline Works
A repeatable word-track system improves confidence, lowers customer uncertainty, and creates a more professional buying experience.

## 2.2 Core Principles
- **Primacy Effect:** early language shapes trust and expectations.
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** simple structure reduces stress and indecision.
- **Choice Architecture:** two-option framing helps guests make decisions.
- **Commitment & Consistency:** confirming priorities increases forward movement.
- **Peak-End Rule:** delivery and follow-up shape long-term memory of the experience.
