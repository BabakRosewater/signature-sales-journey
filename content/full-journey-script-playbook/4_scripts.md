# 4.0 Full Journey Scripts

## 4.1 Power Greeting (First 10 seconds)

### Walk-In
“Welcome to Clark Hyundai — I’m [Name]. What brought you in today: something specific, or are we getting a feel for the lineup?”

“Perfect. While you’re looking, I’ll make this easy — we’ll go at your pace and I’ll keep it simple.”

### Drive-Up
“Hi, welcome in — I’m [Name]. Thanks for coming by. Are you here for a specific vehicle, or comparing a couple options?”

### Inclement Weather
“Hey, I’m [Name] — let’s get you out of the weather. Quick question so I can help: are you shopping a specific model, or just narrowing it down?”

---

## 4.2 Set the Agenda (Reduce anxiety)
“Here’s how we do this so it’s easy: (1) quick questions to understand what matters, (2) we look at the right options, (3) we take a drive, and if you love it, (4) we review numbers. Sound fair?”

“Also, we’re one-price here. My job is to help you choose the right fit — not play games.”

---

## 4.3 Discovery (Needs, use case, decision criteria)
“What made you start looking — what’s changing?”

“What are you driving now, and what do you want to be better this time?”

“Top 3 priorities: features/tech, comfort/space, safety, warranty, color/style — what matters most?”

“How do you use it weekly — commute, kids, road trips, snow, towing?”

“When you say ‘good payment,’ what range feels comfortable without stress?”

“Besides you, who else needs to love this decision?”

### Close Discovery
“Okay — based on what you told me, the right direction is [Model/Trim A] and [Model/Trim B]. I’ll show both and we’ll let the drive make the decision.”

---

## 4.4 Early Trade Conversation (Pre-appraisal positioning)
“Are you replacing a vehicle, or adding one?”

“If you’re trading, perfect — we’ll do a quick look so we’re not guessing later. Is it registered to you, and do you still have a loan on it?”

“No pressure today — I just want accurate numbers when you’re ready.”

---

## 4.5 Vehicle Presentation (Build value, don’t feature-dump)
“Before I show you anything, let me connect what you told me to the vehicle.”

“You said [priority] matters most — this one is strong there because [benefit].”

“Two things I want you to notice right away: [benefit 1] and [benefit 2].”

### If multiple vehicles
“We’re going to do this the smart way: I’ll show you the difference that actually matters, not 40 random features.”

---

## 4.6 Emotional Test Drive (Make it felt, not explained)

### Before leaving the lot
“On this drive, I want you to test it like it’s already yours: braking, merging, turning radius, visibility, and how quiet it is.”

“What would make you say, ‘Yep — this is the one’?”

### During drive (prompting)
“How does the seating feel — more relaxed than your current one?”

“When you accelerate, does it feel confident enough for your daily driving?”

“On a scale of 1–10, how close is this to what you want?”

### After drive
“What did you like most?”

“Anything you’d change if you could?”

“If we can make the numbers work comfortably, do you feel good moving forward with this exact vehicle?”

---

## 4.7 Dealership Tour / Trust Builder (Service + ownership confidence)
“Before we talk numbers, I want you to know who takes care of you after the sale.”

“This is our service drive — the goal is simple: easy scheduling, clear updates, and no surprises.”

“Most people don’t realize Hyundai’s warranty coverage is one of the best — we’ll review it clearly so you know what you own.”

---

## 4.8 Selection & “Hood Ornament” Decision Point (Commit to the unit)
“Between the two options, which one fits you better — and why?”

“If you woke up tomorrow and both were in your driveway, which keys would you grab?”

“Great — so we’re choosing this one: [year/model/trim/color]. If we keep everything simple and the numbers are comfortable, are you ready to move forward?”

---

## 4.9 Numbers / One-Price Presentation (Simple, confident, no rambling)
“Here’s the full picture. This is our best price on the vehicle. From there it’s just math: trade, taxes, and how you want to structure the payment.”

“Most guests choose one of two paths: finance for ownership, or lease for flexibility. Which direction matches your goals?”

### If payment pressure
“Totally fair. Payment is just a result of three things: price, rate, and term. We’ll adjust the structure — not the truth.”

---

## 4.10 Objection Handling (Calm, factual, caring)

### “I need to think about it.”
“Of course. When people say that, it’s usually one of three things: the vehicle, the numbers, or the timing. Which one is it for you?”

### “I’m shopping other dealers.”
“You should. The question is: what do you want to compare — the vehicle, or the experience? Because price here is straightforward — and we’ll make the ownership side easy too.”

### “I want to sleep on it.”
“Totally fair. Before you go, what would need to be true tomorrow for you to feel confident saying yes?”

---

## 4.11 The Close (Clear, respectful)
“Based on everything we covered — are you comfortable moving forward with this one?”

“Perfect. I’ll get the next steps started. While we do that, do you prefer to finalize everything today, or set it up so pickup is [date/time]?”

---

## 4.12 Post-Yes (Confirm, reduce buyer’s remorse)
“You made a smart choice — and the reason is [tie to their top priority].”

“Here’s what happens next: paperwork, trade details, delivery walkthrough, and then you’re out.”

---

## 4.13 Delivery (Make it feel premium + ensure zero confusion)
“Before you leave, I want you to feel 100% confident. We’ll pair your phone, set presets, and make sure you know the 3 most important things.”

“If you forget anything, you call or text me directly — you’re not on your own.”

### Delivery Close
“Anything still unclear?”

“Would you like me to set your first service reminder now so you never have to think about it?”

---

## 4.14 Post-Sale Follow-Up (Text + call)

### Same day text
“Hey [Name], it’s [Rep] at Clark Hyundai. Great meeting you today — proud of your decision. If anything comes up tonight, text me here.”

### Next day call
“Quick check — how was the first night with the vehicle? Any questions I can solve in 60 seconds?”

### 3–5 day check
“Now that you’ve driven it a bit, what do you like most so far?”

---

## 4.15 Save-A-Deal / Taillight Follow-Up (critical)
“Hey [Name], it’s [Rep]. Quick update — I’m cleaning up the final details so there are no surprises. Two quick questions: (1) is the insurance set, and (2) is the bank/verifications ready on your end?”

“My goal is simple: smooth delivery and no loose ends.”
